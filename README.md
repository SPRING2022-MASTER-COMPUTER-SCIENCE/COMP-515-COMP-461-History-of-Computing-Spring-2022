# COMP-515-History-of-Computing
 Course Description:   History of Computing explores the development of the technologies that culminate in today's computers.  This includes early and experimental computers, minicomputers, telecommunications and the Internet, the rise of personal computers, historic persons and computing pioneers, early programming languages and operating systems, and primitive video gaming.  Students will work with, program, and replicate physical examples and emulations of the actual technologies.    Course Outcomes: Students will: •	Appreciate and be able to describe a broad history of computing from the 19th century to the present •	Understand and trace the evolution of computational techologies, including digital switching, volatile and long-term data storage, consoles and I/O, and telecommunication. •	Demonstrate a technical understanding of how a 1970s-era computer worked •	Write simple programs in or more early languages, such as FORTRAN or COBOL •	Familiarize themselves with historic operating systems and software •	Appreciate the challenges related to data archival and rescuing data on obsolete media  Technologies Students may work with: •	early personal computers: Altair, Sol, IBM-PC, Commodore PET, Apple II, Z-100 •	minicomputers: PDP-8, PDP-11 •	data media and devices: paper tape, punched cards, reel-to-reel tape, floppy disks •	communication machines: teletypes, amateur radio, telephone switches •	calculators: HP handheld calculators, slide rules, adding machines  •	personal game consoles: Magnavox Odyssey, Atari 2600, Nintendo NES •	operating systems: Unix V, Multics, RSX-11, VMS, CP/M, TOPS-10 •	obsolete languages: Fortran, Cobol, Lisp, Algol, Simula, BASIC •	electronic components and circuits from the 1940s-1980s  Additional Reading: 	 Ceruzzi, A History of Modern Computing, 2003.
